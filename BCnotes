vim FYI: exit edit mode (esc) then / works like ctrl-f in windows (/hello searches document for the string hello)

Default Boundary conditions est in MMSP/include/MMSP.grid.hpp lines 273&274

possible solution to n-dimensional grid BC definition problem:

for (int i=0; i<dim; i++) {
	b0[GRID,i] = 
	b1[GRID,i] = 
	b0[update,i]=
	b1[update,i]=
}

Find out what p0,p1,sp,n0,n1,dx,g0,g1 are
	I think n is used to control the i in GRID(i)
	Most of this is used for parrallel processing stuff
	g0,g1 can be used to tell if parrallelization has occured

Command at MMSP.grid.hpp lines 415&416 that sets default BCs

in MMSP.vector.hpp line 283 it looks like b0 is being recycled to define something for a vector.

In MMSP.utility.hpp

line 30 numerically defines differnt BC options
line 40 tells how the BC operators work (ie, defines the value of the "cell" one step outside of the grid

In general, the code speaks of x, x0, and x1 but I don't see y,y0,y1, z, z0, z1...
	I know that it has to be somewhere though.
MMSP.grid.hpp calls on the utility functions using x as default to define all directions, but it is possible to define each individually
	line 1082, but I don't see b0 anywhere in there
	sets up in line 29 - does include b0

Why does the MMSP documentation define grid utility commands including GRID, I thought GRID was like a variable name that could be changed to anything?!
